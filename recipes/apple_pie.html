            An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling is apples. Apple pie is often served with whipped
            cream, ice cream ("apple pie Ã  la mode"), custard or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with
            pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise
            strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it from getting soggy. Tarte Tatin is
            baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Apples:</strong> This recipe calls for eight small Granny Smith apples.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Butter and flour:</strong> The filling starts with butter and all-purpose flour cooked into a
                paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugars:</strong> A blend of white and brown sugar creates the perfect sweet flavor with a hint
                of warmth.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pie crust:</strong> Use a store-bought double crust pie pastry or make your own at home.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the filling:</strong> On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and
                water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the pie:</strong> Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the
                bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the
                butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the pie:</strong> Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust
                is golden brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
